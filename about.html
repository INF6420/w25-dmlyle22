            <p> Welcome! This website is a space where I share a wide range of my arts and crafts projects. 
                Creativity has always been a big part of who I am, and I love exploring different mediums 
                and techniques. Nature and the outdoors are constant sources of inspiration for me, and I 
                often incorporate those elements into my work.
            <br><br>
                Although I’ve always been passionate about art, I chose to pursue a degree in business logistics
                in college, believing it would offer more financial stability. Even so, my creative spirit never 
                left—I poured it into my crafting whenever I could.
            <br><br>
                Now, I’m excited to shift my focus and dedicate more time to my artistic pursuits. I'm actively 
                exploring ways to share and market my work in today’s digital world, and I’m looking forward to 
                seeing where this journey takes me.
